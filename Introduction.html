<p>The television industry has come far in terms of its technological developments since the 1960s. One such development is the invention of the colored television, which eventually replaced black-and-white television in the 1970s. Another development is cable television, which first appeared in rural communities (Tucker, 2022). It then broadened its scope to reach national programs and a diverse range of channels. The switch from analog to digital television happened in 2009 which resulted in improved picture quality while simultaneously freeing up the broadcasting spectrum. In the next year, more than half of American residences had high-definition televisions that provided an experience similar to the cinemas (Media and Culture, n.d.).</p>

<p>Since the 1960s, the television industry has seen important technological developments, such as the Color television which gained popularity in the late 1960s, eventually replacing black-and-white television in the 1970s. Another is Cable television, which initially emerged in the 1940s serving rural communities (Tucker, 2022). This later expanded its reach to include national programming and a diversified range of channels. Finally, the switch from analog to digital television in 2009 enhanced picture quality and freed up broadcasting spectrum. By 2010, over half of American homes had high-definition televisions, offering a cinematic viewing experience (Media and Culture, n.d.).

<p>Despite its dominance, the traditional television industry now faces a new challenge as rapid advancements in Internet technology set the stage for a new era of content consumption. The challenger, Netflix, capitalized on these technological changes, introducing on-demand content that offered convenience and flexibility. Although Netflix began as a DVD rental service in 1997 (Netflix, n.d.), it has since grown to become a world leader in on-demand video streaming, radically changing the way people watch media. As a result, it has developed into a disruptive technology and becomes a serious threat to the established television industry.
</p>
<p>It is because of such a situation that we would like to discuss Netflix and its disruptive influence on the traditional television industry. This report shall include a thorough analysis of Netflix as a disruptive technology and its impact on consumer viewing habits. It would also tackle the current situation of traditional television networks and their feedback on streaming services, particularly Netflix. The potential risks to media preservation caused by streaming platformsâ€™ digital-first approach are explored as well. However, the study is confined to the examination of Netflix as a representative case disruption and does not contain financial metrics or operational information of competing streaming platforms. Ultimately, this report offers insights into the revolutionization of the television industry caused by Netflix and its implications for the future of media consumption.
