    <h2>The Future Implications of this Impact</h2><img src="9st.png">
    <ol>
    <p> style="text-align: center;">In 2017, Netflix released an adventure show titled Puss in Book: Trap in an Epic Tale where they first launched their interactive fiction feature. Initially, their target audience was children, but then they saw its potential and began targeting adult viewers with the show Black Mirror: Bandersnatch. This feature lets users control how the characters in the show respond, influencing the flow of the story. This becomes possible because of the crucial role that Artificial Intelligence (AI) plays. It eases the modification of a storyline's progress. Aside from AI, Virtual Reality (VR) was also introduced on Netflix years ago, around 2016, where users watched content on Netflix while being in a virtual environment, like a simulated living room. Experiments like this on streaming platforms prove how they are exploring new forms of engagement in the media and entertainment sector. Therefore, when these two technologies—AI and VR—are combined within content, it might not only alter the storyline, but it can also affect how users explore and internalize the flow of the story. Additionally, if Netflix converges these two within its platform, it might set them apart from their competitors in the industry, especially traditional television.</p>
    <p>Netflix has numerous competitors in the industry. There are niche platforms such as Disney+, Prime Video, Crunchyroll, etc., which cater to different user preferences, and these platforms continue to grow. They might threaten Netflix's user loyalty if Netflix doesn't consider more hyper-personalized recommendations powered by AI and better localization of content. Additionally, the globalization of content that Netflix has been doing might be one of the trends that helped them expand their global subscriber base, setting them apart from regional television networks. Netflix continues to target both global and local audiences. Another trend that Netflix might need to consider is applying green practices within their platform. They could attract environmentally conscious individuals by marketing eco-friendly sustainable efforts, especially since traditional television has been criticized for wasteful energy practices.</p>
    <p>Despite these advantages of streaming platforms like Netflix, there are still things where they are less competitive compared to traditional televisions—live events. These kinds of live shows might be the strongest advantage television has, as it offers a real-time experience of events like sports and news. This keeps traditional TV networks relevant even up to these days. Older generations might also prefer and remain loyal to traditional television because it offers simplicity and familiarity. However, younger generations prefer digital streaming services, which challenges the traditional television industry to adapt to younger audiences' preferences unless they upgrade their delivery model. If not, their relevance across almost all generations might decline, causing them to play a smaller role in the broader entertainment industry. However, if they collaborate with streaming platforms, it might help them reach a wider scope of viewers.</p>
    <p>Opportunities and risks are inevitable, and streaming platforms such as Netflix experience them too. One opportunity they might adapt to in the future is enhancing creativity with content formats. Pushing the limits of how storytelling is performed may attract younger generations, particularly tech-savvy ones, which could set them further apart from competitors, especially the traditional television industry. Experimenting with formats can be an advantage to gain more loyal viewers.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, with the rise of many streaming platforms, consumers might feel overwhelmed since not all content can be watched or accessed on a single platform. Netflix might need to compete harder than usual, as there’s a possibility their users could switch to cheaper yet quality streaming platforms offering free ad-supported services. To address this, Netflix might need to apply marketing strategies like discounts or create exclusive content that piques viewers' interest.</p>
